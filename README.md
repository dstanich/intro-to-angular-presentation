Presentation given to...
* 2018-05-10 IBM Rochester FED@IBM

## Overview
Introduction to basic concepts of Angular (2+).  Covers mostly `angular-cli` and components with a small example of services and http requests.  Slides available at: [https://dstanich.github.io/intro-to-angular-presentation/](https://dstanich.github.io/intro-to-angular-presentation/).

Each branch starts with a base set of files which contains a `README.md` file that describes the steps needed to accomplish the goal for that branch.  To see expected output, you can view the `master`'s `README.md` and view the StackBlitz link.

## Materials
All code is available in this repository in branches.

### Setup (Local)
1.  `npm install -g @angular/cli`
2.  Clone this repository
3.  `cd intro-to-angular-presentation && npm install`
4.  Then `cd` into either `examples` or `space` and run `npm start` to run a demo

### Setup (StackBlitz)
[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) can be used to load each branch into a live editor and browser without any local setup.  Links for each branch are in the table below.  There is one for a starting point before the changes in the branch and one for after the changes.
